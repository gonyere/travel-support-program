# Ensure the MySQL connector gem is defined in your Gemfile
# gem 'mysql2'

# Warning: this proposes the usage of the root user with no password.
# That's done for simplicity because this docker manifest is only meant for
# development purposes and, for that, a user with privileges to create and
# destroy databases is very convenient.
# NEVER use such setup in a production system.

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
